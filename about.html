                Founded in 1998, Fox Valley Realty began as a small, family-run agency with a simple mission — to make the dream of homeownership accessible to everyone in Wisconsin’s Fox Valley region. What started as one office in downtown Appleton quickly grew through word-of-mouth referrals and a reputation for honesty, local knowledge, and personalized service. Early on, the agency became known for its hands-on approach, guiding first-time buyers through every step of the process while building long-term relationships based on trust and transparency.

                Over the years, Fox Valley Realty has evolved alongside the community it serves. Embracing new technologies, the agency now offers virtual home tours, online listings, and data-driven market insights while maintaining the same neighborly values that defined its beginnings. Today, Fox Valley Realty is proud to be a cornerstone of the region’s real estate market — blending modern tools with a hometown touch to help families, investors, and businesses find their perfect place to call home.

                As the housing market changed throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Fox Valley Realty adapted to meet the needs of a new generation of buyers and sellers. The agency expanded its services beyond residential homes, offering expertise in commercial properties, new developments, and investment opportunities. By partnering with local builders, mortgage professionals, and community organizations, Fox Valley Realty became a trusted name not just for finding homes, but for helping shape neighborhoods across the Fox Valley.
